# PrivacyTools Whistleblower Protection Policy

PrivacyTools requires Team members to observe high standards of organizational and personal
ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. As representatives of PrivacyTools and its community,
we must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling our responsibilities.

## Reporting Responsibility

This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable team members, contributors and others
to raise serious concerns internally so that the PrivacyTools team can address and
correct inappropriate conduct and actions. It is the responsibility 
of all team members and contributors to report concerns about violations of PrivacyTools’s code of conduct.

## No Retaliation

It is contrary to the values of PrivacyTools for anyone to retaliate against any team member, contributor or other
who in good faith reports a code of conduct violation. A team member who retaliates against someone who has reported
a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of their position in the PrivacyTools team.

## Reporting Procedure

PrivacyTools has an open door policy and suggests that team members, contributors, and others share
their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints with the internal compliance officer.
If you are not comfortable speaking with the internal compliance officer or you are not satisfied
with the internal compliance officer’s response, you are encouraged to speak with the external compliance officer.
Team members and contributors are encouraged to report complaints or concerns about
suspected ethical and policy violations in writing to either of the PrivacyTools compliance officer’s,
who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints.     

## Compliance

The PrivacyTools’s compliance officers are responsible for ensuring that all complaints about unethical conduct or
policy violations are investigated and resolved.

## Acting in Good Faith

Anyone filing a written complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation must be acting in
good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation.
Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or
knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious offense.

## Confidentiality

Violations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis by the complainant.
Reports of violations or suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible,
consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.

## Handling of Reported Violations

The PrivacyTools compliance officer will notify the person who submitted a complaint and
acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation.
All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation.
